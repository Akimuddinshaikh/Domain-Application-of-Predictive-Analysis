📌 Project Overview
This research project focuses on predicting house prices in the Indian real estate market using machine learning techniques. It is based on the Kaggle "House Price Prediction Challenge" dataset, which provides detailed information on property characteristics. The project aims to develop a robust predictive model to help real estate investors, home buyers, and analysts make informed decisions.

🔍 Key Objectives
✅ Analyze real estate data and identify factors influencing property prices.
✅ Implement Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models for predictive analysis.
✅ Compare models based on performance metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, etc.).
✅ Provide insights into domain-specific real estate applications using data-driven techniques.


📊 Machine Learning Techniques Used
Model	R² Score	RMSE	MAE	Dataset
Random Forest	High	Low	Low	Indian Dataset
Decision Tree	Moderate	Medium	Medium	Indian Dataset
Linear Regression	Low	High	High	Indian Dataset
🔹 Key Finding: Random Forest performed best in predicting house prices in India.
🔹 Feature Importance Analysis helped identify top influencing property attributes.
🔹 Model Performance Varied due to dataset characteristics, outliers, and feature selection.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Regression Models)
Kaggle Dataset (House Price Data)

📌 Results & Insights
✅ Random Forest was the best-performing model for house price prediction.
✅ Feature engineering & preprocessing significantly impacted accuracy.
✅ Linear regression had poor performance due to nonlinear dependencies in the dataset.
✅ Decision trees provided interpretability but were prone to overfitting.

📌 Future Work
✔ Explore Deep Learning models (e.g., ANN, CNN) for better predictions.
✔ Feature Engineering: Incorporate location-based features & external economic indicators.
✔ Develop a web-based tool for users to predict house prices dynamically.
